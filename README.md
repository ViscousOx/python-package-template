# python-package-template
my go to template for a project that outputs a python package. this was made with the intent to use with PyCharm 
so an `.idea` folder is included. you will need to update these for your project if you want to use them.

Steps to update for your project
1. run `mise install`
2. update all instances of package_name and package-name with your project name 
3. run `uv sync`
